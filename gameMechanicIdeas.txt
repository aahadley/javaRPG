NPC actions (non-combat):


Combat:

    Turn-based system. We could use the player level, dice rolls, skill checks, 
    and critical percentages. We could also take into account the 
    opponent's protection (armor, clothing, etc.) as well as the 
    opponent's level, so that the damage done to the opponent is the
    difference between these calculations. For example, if the player's
    numbers add up to 12, and the opponent's add up to 10, the damage done
    will be 2. But if the player's number is 8, and the opponent 10, then no
    damage will be done. 

    As we figure out what the attributes and skills will look like for our
    player, we can refine this a bit more.
